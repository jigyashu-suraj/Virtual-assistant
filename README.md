# Virtual-assistant
In this project I have built one virtual assistant using some simple python commands . Basically it can perform three tasks .

### 1) It can open the apps from your laptop .
I have added a number of apps that we use in daily basis . It can open the app when you just type open and the name of the application . And the best thing is instead of open
you can write any other word like run / execute / start etc . It can understand yor language and will opwn the required app for you .

### 2) It can search anything for you in web .
By using this virtual assistant you can search any kind of text and keyword that comes to your mindjust by typing search and the keyword name . And again instead of search you can write anything like find / open etc . It can get you the task you want it to perform .

### 3) It can open any url from web . 
By using this project you can open up any website from internet just by pasting the url of the website . It will open your browser go to the perticular website whose url you have provided over there and open up that website for you .

### Closing the assistant :
To close this one you have to just type exit / quit / stop like this , It will thank you for using it and will be closed .

## Pre-requisite:
You need the knowledge of python programming aspecially the modules that it is having in it .
